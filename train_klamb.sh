# Project notes:
 # compute the teachers loss on the validation set
    # compute the ensemble's loss on the validation set
    # we want one loss for the teacher - how well does the teacher predict stuff
    # at the end of every training cycle, compute the ensemble's loss and see how well it performs on the validation set
    # graph the baseline teacher loss to the ensemble performance as we add more models
    # does the training and ensemble adding decrease the validation loss and the similarity to the teacher
    # two benchmarks - validation loss (how good it is at predicting instructions and similarity to the ground truth); similarity of ensemble and the teacher 
    # dump numerical results into a file and then upldoa into a notebook
    # put in a colab - ask Claude how to best store evaluation metrics
    # also maybe mark the time it takes to train and evaluate 
    # Setup wandb for this round
    
    # timeline
        # have the results which would go int the paper by the end of the internship so that I can write up a paper
        # need to see which distilation approaches work the best
        # scale up methods after we found the best ones that work
        # reinforcement learning for ensembles
        # right now trying to get some signal on what works
    # plan to run code for the night; forsight; work on the code during the day
    # have a clear goal of what I need to do next
    # what are the immediate todos are on my part?
        # have the code in running condition - if I run it trains something, and trains it correctly
        # implement the validation loss and the teacher-student-kl loss and comparison
        # evaluate what happnes with the first run when I evaluate ensemble members
        # read over my paper notes and search for other methods and approaches
        # validation loss isn't going down? hwo similar it is to the teacher? -> will tell us where to go next
